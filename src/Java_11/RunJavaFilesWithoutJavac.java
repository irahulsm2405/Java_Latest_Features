package Java_11;

/*
    Before Java 11, to run a Java program you had to:
    Compile: javac HelloWorld.java
    Run: java HelloWorld

    Now in Java 11, you can run a single source file directly:
    java HelloWorld.java

    run in cmd: java HelloWorld.java

    Why itâ€™s useful

    Perfect for:
    Quick testing of small code snippets.
    Interview prep / coding challenges.
    Learning and experimenting without project setup.
    No .class file clutter unless you explicitly compile
