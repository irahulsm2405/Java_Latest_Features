Java 8 Major Features

Lambda Expressions

Functional Interfaces (@FunctionalInterface)

Streams API (for functional-style operations on collections)

Default Methods in Interfaces (methods with implementation in interfaces)

Method References (ClassName::methodName syntax)

Optional Class (to handle null values safely)

New Date and Time API (java.time package with LocalDate, LocalTime, etc.)

Nashorn JavaScript Engine (embedded JavaScript runtime)

Repeating Annotations (apply same annotation multiple times)

Type Annotations (annotations on types, usable with pluggable type systems)

Parallel Array Operations (Arrays.parallelSort(), etc.)

CompletableFuture API (for asynchronous programming and better concurrency support)

Base64 Encoding and Decoding API (java.util.Base64)

Concurrent Accumulators (e.g., LongAdder, DoubleAdder for better concurrency performance)

Metaspace (replacement of PermGen for JVM memory management)

StringJoiner class (to join strings with delimiter easily)

Improved Type Inference (better support for generics with diamond operator)
